# Create Plain App

A tiny CLI that creates a barebones web app without a buildstep. Most modern browsers now ship with support for [ES-Modules](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module) and [ES6](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6) meaning that you may not need a build step for your projects.

```
npx create-plain-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
